# Sprint 8 Project
> Jennifer Teh

In this project, I wrote several tests to check the functionality of Urban Routes.  

Software needed to run:  WebDriverIO, Chrome

Setup for running tests:
-Clone the repository to a directory
-In the terminal, in the directory, run the command "npm install"
-Start the TripleTen server and copy the address
-Paste the server address in the "wdio.config.js" file under "baseUrl" variable
-To run all tests together, run the "npm run wdio" command in the terminal

Expected results:
-All 8 tests are supposed to return PASS

Coding style:
-camelCase is used
-No unnecessary variables have been declared
-Every variable name describes the value saved in it
-No unnecessary comments have been made
-Each test has a descriptive title
